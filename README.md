# LedPack

This is project contains the implementation of a led platine fitted with two 74HC595 shift registers controlled by an Adriuno Uno.
These shift registers control 14 leds on the platine, resembling a heart.

There are three options planned for the led platine. It should be able to play a funky light show with the leds fitted on the platine. 
Also the heart should pump to music. A ky038 sensor module is used to process the sound inputs herefore.

The last mode is the gyroscope mode, where a GY-521 sensor module is used to let the heart on the platine react to the movement of the sensor.
